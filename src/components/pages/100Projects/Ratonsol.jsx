        Today, I will be walking you through RATONSOL, an imaginary memetoken I've created for you all. 
        We will be using it as a template for developing meme tokens, both for frontend and smart contract development. Feel free to copy the contract and customize it to your liking. Since it's my first attempt üòÇ, I'd appreciate all your feedback. Please send your reviews to me via my social platform.

              integrate the token.

              ERC20: Inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation,
              providing standard ERC20 token functionalities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ownable: Inherits from the OpenZeppelin Ownable contract,

            <li>
              TOTAL_SUPPLY: Defines the total token supply, set to 1 billion
              tokens (1,000,000,000) with 18 decimal places.
            </li>

                ERC20("RatOnSol", "ROL"): Calls the constructor of the ERC20
                contract with the token name "RatOnSol" and the ticker symbol
                "ROL".
              </li>

          <p>This contract creates the RatOnSol token with the ticker symbol "ROL" and a total supply of 1 billion tokens. The initial supply is assigned to the deploying address, which is passed as an argument during deployment. The contract inherits standard ERC20 functionalities and includes ownership functionalities provided by Ownable.</p>
